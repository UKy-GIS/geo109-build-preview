<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Mapping is both art and science, and long considered unique to geography&rsquo;s artistic, communicative, and scientific traditions. This course introduces concepts and techniques that enable mapping as a creative and artistic practice. We&rsquo;ll examine the map&rsquo;s centrality in everyday life and the changing role of the mapmaker as society becomes increasingly saturated by digital information technologies.</p>
<p>We also explore web mapping tools and location-based services and their relationship with traditional mapping technologies, like a Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The course introduces cartographic design, geovisualization, ethics of digital mapping, and map critique.</p>
<p>The course culminates in a series of maps created by you. 🚀 🗺</p>
<h3 id="course-goals-and-objectives">Course Goals and Objectives</h3>
<p>In utilizing the creative process of digital mapping, we shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trace the technological developments and conceptual debates that situate contemporary
digital mapping as art and creative practice;</li>
<li>Explore the variety of digital mapping technologies available for creative and artistic
representations of spatial phenomena;</li>
<li>Create maps through digital processes using web and desktop software; and</li>
<li>Critique existing digital maps and tools, as well as those creative works produced by
your colleagues in the course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the completion of this course, you shall be able to personally create maps that demonstrate
an engagement with the creative and artistic processes of digital mapping, both as an individual
and as part of a collaborative endeavor. As part of this process, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply principles of map design to create maps that are coherent and convincing as well as
technically correct, choosing an appropriate representation for their data set or project goal;</li>
<li>Situate contemporary digital mapping within technological developments and
theoretical debates;</li>
<li>Critique cartographic products and web mapping applications to assess some of their potential
social, political, and aesthetic implications; and</li>
<li>Evaluate results of your creative endeavors in class and discover how to reassess and refine your work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>This course has two lectures and one lab each week that require dedicated participation. Lectures present our fundamental concepts and creative goals. Labs implement these concepts and goals through ‘hands-on’ software exercises, exploring digital mapping techniques, engaging in class discussions, and creating maps.</p>
<h3 id="required-resources">Required resources</h3>
<p>While there are no required books for this class, there will be assigned readings, videos, etc. which will be made available on Canvas. You are attending a research 1 university, taking classes with people who do original research. As such, you may have the opportunity to read journal articles, book chapters, and maps published by your professors. Professors are not paid royalties for these publications, but they are how information is disseminated for the academic community.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>Our computer lab has all of required software installed. If you would like this software installed on your computer, download and install the following free software:</p>

<h2 id="course-assignments-and-grading">Course Assignments and Grading</h2>
<p>This course requires the completion of five labs, one exam &amp; final project, and a variety of tasks and discussions. Grade requirements are weighted as detailed below:</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong>: Five labs @ 10% each<br>
<strong>Midterm</strong>: 10%<br>
<strong>Final Project</strong>: 20%<br>
<strong>Tasks and discussions</strong>: 20%</p>
<h3 id="lab-topics">Lab Topics</h3>
<p>Completed labs will be submitted as a PDF, ZIP, or URL in Canvas. They should be submitted by 11:59 pm on the day that they are due.</p>
<p><strong>1: Data</strong><br>
Create your first spatial data set.</p>
<p><strong>2: GPS</strong><br>
Harness signals from space to find your way.</p>
<p><strong>3: GIS</strong><br>
Analyze data to find patterns and relationships.</p>
<p><strong>4: Cartography</strong><br>
Visualyze these patterns and relationships on a map&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>5: Design</strong><br>
&hellip;and then make it   <span class='fancy-text fancy-text-large-inline'>fancy</span>.</p>
<h3 id="midterm-exam">Midterm Exam</h3>
<p>The first half of the semester explores how to create, manage, and visualize spatial data. This skill is a fundamental requirement to make maps and this exam will evaluate your knowledge of the three prior modules. The exam will be a take-home, online exam scheduled for October 17 during lecture time.</p>
<h3 id="tasks-and-discussions">Tasks and Discussions</h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, short graded tasks will be assigned and could serve as a prompt for class discussions. Some tasks require out-of-class work, such as visiting the Map Library and walking around campus. Some tasks and discussions will be announced only during lecture. Make it to class, do the tasks, and share your thoughts to receive full credit for this portion of your grade.</p>
<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>
<p>You will create a map! Theme, format, and topic is wholly your choice. The exact specifications of the project will be addressed later in the semester. The general requirements of the project include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proposal</li>
<li>Map Draft</li>
<li>Critique</li>
<li>Refinement and Final Map</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="grading-scale-and-rubric">Grading scale and Rubric</h3>
<p>When creating your lab submissions, think about these three dimensions of your work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data design: does the data effectively represent the observed phenomena?</li>
<li>Map design: is the map well-organized and have appropriate supporting content?</li>
<li>Narrative design: what does the map communicate and is it engaging/persuasive?</li>
</ul>
<p>Grade: A (90% to 100%) Excellent: You show a complete understanding of course materials and turn in assignments by the due date that are error-free, well-organized, and regularly show originality and creativity. Your participation in discussions is active, thoughtful, and helps to lead class learning.</p>
<p>Grade: B (80% to 89%) Good: You show a good grasp of key concepts within course materials and turn in the majority of work promptly that contains a few errors, but is organized and occasionally original and creative. Participation in discussions is active and contributes to ongoing conversations and work.</p>
<p>Grade: C (70% to 79%) Average: You show a basic understanding of key concepts within course materials and turn in work often late and contains some errors but meets the assignment goals. Work is rarely original and creative. Your participation in discussions and group work primarily contributes to established conversations and work.</p>
<p>Grade: D (60% to 69%) Insufficient: You show gaps in understanding of concepts within the course and fail to complete projects and exercises correctly and/or promptly. You have weak engagement in discussions.</p>
<p>Grade: E (below 60%) Failure: You show major gaps in understanding many concepts within the course and fail to complete projects and exercises correctly and timely. You do not engage in discussions.</p>
<h2 id="course-schedule">Course Schedule</h2>
<p>The schedule is preliminary. Any changes will be announced on Canvas and changed in this document.</p>

<li>other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for non-attendance” by the instructor of record.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students should notify the professor of absences prior to class when possible. In addition to these policies, this course recognizes that a documented network or platform outage, e.g., Canvas not working, justifies an excused absence. Technical problems and scheduling conflicts also arise from time-to-time, and we recognize that assignments need to be turned in late. Please notify the instructor as soon as possible if you anticipate a late assignment to discuss a “reasonable cause for non-attendance” and justify an excused absence.</p>
<h4 id="policy-on-generative-ai">Policy on Generative AI</h4>
<p>GenAI tools such as ChatGPT may be used in this course for the purposes of brainstorming, testing, debugging, and discovering code. However, you are responsible for submitting work that meets the assignment standards for quality and factual accuracy.</p>
<p>Before submitting any assignment that was aided by GenAI, you are responsible for fact-checking all statements and ensuring that any content drawn from other sources – including the use of GenAI – is appropriately acknowledged through the citation practices used in this course.</p>
<p>For example, if you use ChatGPT in a submission, you should cite: Text (or image) generated by (or adapted from) ChatGPT, March 1, 2024, OpenAI, <a href="https://chat.openai.com">https://chat.openai.com</a>. as a citation in your layout. Because you will likely modify the generated code to meet your goals, add additional comments that highlight the changes you made.</p>
<p>By keeping track of your AI use and sharing your experiences, we all gain understanding, identify potential issues in this rapidly changing field, and discover better ways to use the resources for our objectives.</p>
<h4 id="class-behavior-and-civility">Class Behavior and Civility</h4>

<ul>

<li>disturbances that interfere with course instruction and learning;</li>
<li>content that degrades an individual or group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructor reserves the right to stop and remove content that conflicts with the above statement.</p>
<h4 id="chosen-names-and-personal-pronouns">Chosen Names and Personal Pronouns</h4>
<p>Everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, including non-binary pronouns, for example, they/them/theirs, ze/zir/zirs, etc. Course rosters may not list gender or pronouns, so you may be asked to indicate the pronouns you use so that the instructor does not make assumptions based on your name and/or appearance/self-presentation (you are not obligated to do so). If you use a chosen name, please let the instructor know. Chosen names and pronouns are to be respected at all times in this course. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen, so we should encourage openness to correction and learning. Chosen names and personal pronouns may evolve, so if at any point during the semester you would like to be addressed differently, please let the instructor know.</p>
