<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Mapping is both art and science, and long considered unique to geography&rsquo;s artistic, communicative, and scientific traditions. This course introduces concepts and techniques that enable mapping as a creative and artistic practice. We&rsquo;ll examine the map&rsquo;s centrality in everyday life and the changing role of the mapmaker as society becomes increasingly saturated by digital information technologies.</p>
<p>We also explore web mapping tools and location-based services and their relationship with traditional mapping technologies, like a Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The course introduces cartographic design, geovisualization, ethics of digital mapping, and map critique.</p>
<p>The course culminates in a series of maps created by you. 🚀 🗺</p>
<h3 id="course-goals-and-objectives">Course Goals and Objectives</h3>
<p>In utilizing the creative process of digital mapping, we shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trace the technological developments and conceptual debates that situate contemporary
digital mapping as art and creative practice;</li>
<li>Explore the variety of digital mapping technologies available for creative and artistic
representations of spatial phenomena;</li>
<li>Create maps through digital processes using web and desktop software; and</li>
<li>Critique existing digital maps and tools, as well as those creative works produced by
your colleagues in the course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the completion of this course, you shall be able to personally create maps that demonstrate
an engagement with the creative and artistic processes of digital mapping, both as an individual
and as part of a collaborative endeavor. As part of this process, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply principles of map design to create maps that are coherent and convincing as well as
technically correct, choosing an appropriate representation for their data set or project goal;</li>
<li>Situate contemporary digital mapping within technological developments and
theoretical debates;</li>
<li>Critique cartographic products and web mapping applications to assess some of their potential
social, political, and aesthetic implications; and</li>
<li>Evaluate results of your creative endeavors in class and discover how to reassess and refine your work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>This course has two lectures and one lab each week that require dedicated participation. Lectures present our fundamental concepts and creative goals. Labs implement these concepts and goals through ‘hands-on’ software exercises, exploring digital mapping techniques, engaging in class discussions, and creating maps.</p>
<p>We have a number of field trips planned this semester.</p>
<h3 id="required-resources">Required resources</h3>
<p>While there are no required books for this class, there will be assigned readings, videos, etc. which will be made available on Canvas. You are attending a research 1 university, taking classes with people who do original research. As such, you may have the opportunity to read journal articles, book chapters, and maps published by your professors. Professors are not paid royalties for these publications, but they are how information is disseminated for the academic community.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>Our computer lab has all of required software installed. If you would like this software installed on your computer, download and install the following free software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop mapping: <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a></li>
<li>Web mapping: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio">Mapbox Studio</a> (runs in browser, just need free Mapbox account)</li>
<li>Mobile mapping: <a href="https://www.avenzamaps.com/mobile-maps">Avenza Maps</a> (runs on mobile device)</li>
<li>Code and data editor: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hardware">Hardware</h4>
<p>You are encouraged to have access to a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) with location services enabled for applications that we introduce in class. You are likely eligible to use an iPad for this course via UKy&rsquo;s <a href="https://smartcampus.uky.edu/ipad-initiative">iPad Initiative</a>.</p>
<h2 id="course-assignments-and-grading">Course Assignments and Grading</h2>
<p>This course requires the completion of five labs, one exam &amp; final project, and a variety of tasks and discussions. Grade requirements are weighted as detailed below:</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong>: Five labs @ 10% each<br>
<strong>Midterm</strong>: 10%<br>
<strong>Final Project</strong>: 20%<br>
<strong>Tasks and discussions</strong>: 20%</p>
<h3 id="lab-topics">Lab Topics</h3>
<p>Completed labs will be submitted as a PDF, ZIP, or URL in Canvas. They should be submitted by 11:59 pm on the day that they are due.</p>
<p><strong>1: Data</strong><br>
Create your first spatial data set.</p>
<p><strong>2: GPS</strong><br>
Harness signals from space to find your way.</p>
<p><strong>3: GIS</strong><br>
Analyze data to find patterns and relationships.</p>
<p><strong>4: Cartography</strong><br>
Visualyze these patterns and relationships on a map&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>5: Design</strong><br>
&hellip;and then make it   <span class='fancy-text fancy-text-large-inline'>fancy</span>.</p>
<h3 id="midterm-exam">Midterm Exam</h3>
<p>The first half of the semester explores how to create, manage, and visualize spatial data. This skill is a fundamental requirement to make maps and this exam will evaulate your knowledge of the three prior modules. The exam will be a take-home, online exam. You will have one week to complete the exam.</p>
<h3 id="tasks-and-discussions">Tasks and Discussions</h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, short tasks will be assigned and could serve as a prompt for class discussions. We will also have a few field trips that have a graded component. Some tasks and discussions will be announced only during lecture. Make it to class, do the tasks, and share your thoughts to receive full credit for this portion of your grade.</p>
<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>
<p>You will create a map! Theme, format, and topic is wholly your choice. The exact specifications of the project will be addressed later in the semester. The general requirements of the project include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proposal</li>
<li>Map Draft</li>
<li>Critique</li>
<li>Refinement and Final Map</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="grading-scale-and-rubric">Grading scale and Rubric</h3>
<p>When creating your lab submissions, think about these three dimensions of your work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data design: does the data effectively represent the observed phenomena?</li>
<li>Map design: is the map well-organized and have appropriate supporting content?</li>
<li>Narrative design: what does the map communicate and is it engaging/persuasive?</li>
</ul>
<p>Grade: A (90% to 100%) Excellent: You show a complete understanding of course materials and turn in assignments by the due date that are error-free, well-organized, and regularly show originality and creativity. Your participation in discussions is active, thoughtful, and helps to lead class learning.</p>
<p>Grade: B (80% to 89%) Good: You show a good grasp of key concepts within course materials and turn in the majority of work promptly that contains a few errors, but is organized and occasionally original and creative. Participation in discussions is active and contributes to ongoing conversations and work.</p>
<p>Grade: C (70% to 79%) Average: You show a basic understanding of key concepts within course materials and turn in work often late and contains some errors but meets the assignment goals. Work is rarely original and creative. Your participation in discussions and group work primarily contributes to established conversations and work.</p>
<p>Grade: D (60% to 69%) Insufficient: You show gaps in understanding of concepts within the course and fail to complete projects and exercises correctly and/or promptly. You have weak engagement in discussions.</p>
<p>Grade: E (below 60%) Failure: You show major gaps in understanding many concepts within the course and fail to complete projects and exercises correctly and timely. You do not engage in discussions.</p>
<h2 id="course-schedule">Course Schedule</h2>
<p>The schedule is preliminary. Any changes will be announced on Canvas and changed in this document.</p>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<h4 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h4>
<p>You are expected to attend all classes, but attendance will not be recorded. Please note that you will not adequately complete course requirements without excellent attendance.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
<p>Collaboration on labs is allowed. If you collaborate, please observe the following expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please acknowledge your collaborators in your submission; and</li>
<li>Submit you assignment independently.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission-of-assignments">Submission of Assignments</h4>
<p>All assignments must be submitted through Canvas by no later than 11:59 pm EDT on the day they are due (typically, Sunday). Eact submission dates for each assignment can found in the Course schedule section.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>One point will be deducted automatically for an unexcused late assignment, and one additional point will be deducted for every 72-hour period that the assignment is late after the submission date. Students with excused absences approved by the instructor will not be penalized. Late assignments submitted without an excused absence may not receive submission comments with the evaluation.</p>
<h4 id="excused-absences">Excused Absences</h4>
<p>Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant illness;</li>
<li>death of a family member;</li>
<li>trips for members of student organizations sponsored by an educational unit, trips for University classes, and trips for participation in intercollegiate athletic events;</li>
<li>major religious holidays;</li>
<li>interviews for graduate/professional school or full-time employment post-graduation; and</li>
<li>other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for non-attendance” by the instructor of record.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students should notify the professor of absences prior to class when possible. In addition to these policies, this course recognizes that a documented network or platform outage, e.g., Canvas not working, justifies an excused absence. Technical problems and scheduling conflicts also arise from time-to-time, and we recognize that assignments need to be turned in late. Please notify the instructor as soon as possible if you anticipate a late assignment to discuss a “reasonable cause for non-attendance” and justify an excused absence.</p>
<h4 id="withdrawincomplete-policy">Withdraw/Incomplete Policy</h4>
<p>Officially withdrawing from the class is required by the registrar to avoid a failing grade. The instructor will not withdraw you automatically because you quit attending class. The Schedule of Classes lists the date that a student may withdraw from the class at their discretion without a W and the date that they may still withdraw at their discretion but receive a W on their transcript for the course. Consult the university calendar to find the last date to drop a course without it appearing on the student’s transcript. After that date, students can withdraw or reduce course load after this date only for urgent non-academic reasons.</p>
<h4 id="course-material-copyright-statement">Course Material Copyright Statement</h4>
<p>The University of Kentucky Code of Student Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress.</p>
<p>All video and audio recordings of lectures and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and cannot be copied, shared, or redistributed.</p>
<p>As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.</p>
<p>If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent before such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.</p>
<p>Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.</p>
<p>All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures, is the instructors&rsquo; intellectual property and cannot be reproduced or sold without prior permission from the instructors. A student may use the material for reasonable educational and professional purposes extending beyond this class, such as studying for a comprehensive or qualifying examination in a degree program, preparing for a professional or certification examination, or to assist in fulfilling responsibilities at a job or internship.</p>
<h4 id="class-behavior-and-civility">Class Behavior and Civility</h4>
<p>All participants in this course should maintain the highest standards of academic, professional, and personal integrity and support a safe and inclusive learning environment (see the section on non-discrimination). With an understanding of mutual respect and civil discourse, we cultivate an online environment free from:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional harm, hostility, and excessive persuasion;</li>
<li>disturbances that interfere with course instruction and learning;</li>
<li>content that degrades an individual or group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructor reserves the right to stop and remove content (Zoom meetings, discussion posts, etc.) that conflicts with the above statement.</p>
<h4 id="chosen-names-and-personal-pronouns">Chosen Names and Personal Pronouns</h4>
<p>Everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, including non-binary pronouns, for example, they/them/theirs, ze/zir/zirs, etc. Course rosters may not list gender or pronouns, so you may be asked to indicate the pronouns you use so that the instructor does not make assumptions based on your name and/or appearance/self-presentation (you are not obligated to do so). If you use a chosen name, please let the instructor know. Chosen names and pronouns are to be respected at all times in this course. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen, so we should encourage openness to correction and learning. Chosen names and personal pronouns may evolve, so if at any point during the semester you would like to be addressed differently, please let the instructor know.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignmentsverification-of-absences">Late Assignments—Verification of Absences</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1)</p>
<p>Students may be asked to verify their absences for them to be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.1 states that faculty have the right to request appropriate verification when students claim an excused absence due to: significant illness; death in the household, trips for classes, trips sponsored by an educational unit, and trips for participation related to intercollegiate athletic events; and interviews for full-time job opportunities after graduation and interviews for graduate and professional school. (Appropriate notification of absences due to University-related trips is required before the absence when feasible and in no case more than one week after the absence.)</p>
<h4 id="late-assignmentsreligious-observances">Late Assignments—Religious Observances</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1(4))</p>

<h4 id="late-assignmentsmake-up-work">Late Assignments—Make-Up Work</h4>
<p>(Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.2)</p>
<p>Except where prior notification is required, students missing any graded work due to an excused absence are responsible:</p>
<p>for informing the Instructor of Record about their excused absence within one week following the period of the excused absence;
and for making up the missed work.
The instructor must give the student an opportunity to make up the work and/or the exams missed due to the excused absence, and shall do so, if feasible, during the semester in which the absence occurred. The instructor shall provide the student with an opportunity to make up the graded work and may not simply calculate the student&rsquo;s grade on the basis of the other course requirements unless the student agrees in writing.</p>
<p>For students who add a class after the first day of classes and miss graded work, the instructor shall provide the student with an opportunity to make up the graded work. The instructor may not simply calculate the student&rsquo;s grade on the basis of the other course requirements unless the student agrees in writing.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignmentsexcused-absences-and-wi-all-students">Late Assignments—Excused Absences and W/I, All Students</h4>
<p>(Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.3.1)</p>
<p>If a student has excused absences for more than one-fifth of the required course interactions (e.g., submitting assignments), the student can request a &ldquo;W.&rdquo; If the student declines a “W,” the Instructor of Record may award an “I” for the course.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignmentsexcused-absences-due-to-military-duties">Late Assignments—Excused Absences Due to Military Duties</h4>
<p>(Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.3.2)</p>
<p>If a student must be absent for one-fifth or less of the required course interactions (e.g., submitting assignments) due to military duties, the following procedure applies:</p>
<p>Once a student is aware of a call to duty, the student shall provide a copy of the military orders to the Director of the Veterans Resource Center. The student shall also provide the Director with a list of her/his courses and instructors.
The Director will verify the orders with the appropriate military authority and, on behalf of the military student, notify each Instructor of Record via Department Letterhead as to the known extent of the absence.
The Instructor of Record shall not penalize the student’s absence in any way and shall provide accommodations and time frames so that the student can make up missed assignments, quizzes, and tests in a mutually agreed-upon manner.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-plagiarism">Academic Integrity—Prohibition on Plagiarism</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.1)</p>
<p>Please note that any textual content that you add to the map should be in your own words or <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html">properly cited</a> if you are using someone else&rsquo;s words or content (see the section on plagiarism).</p>
<p>Per University policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the University, may be imposed.</p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty, as explained in the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities . Complete information can be found on the Academic Ombud page. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.</p>
<p>Senate Rule 6.3.1 (see current Senate Rules ) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about a question of plagiarism involving their work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.</p>
<p>When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording, or content from another source without appropriate acknowledgment of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism.</p>
<p>Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else&rsquo;s work (including, but not limited to, a published article, a book, a website, computer code, or a paper from a friend) without clear attribution. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be, except under specific circumstances (e.g., Writing Center review or peer review) allowed by the Instructor of Record or that person’s designee. Plagiarism may also include double submission, self-plagiarism, or unauthorized resubmission of one’s own work, as defined by the instructor.</p>
<p>Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, except where prohibited by the Instructor of Record (e.g., individual take-home exams). However, the actual work must be done by the student, and the student alone, unless collaboration is allowed by the Instructor of Record (e.g., group projects).</p>
<p>When a student&rsquo;s assignment involves research in outside sources or information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where, and how he/she has employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content, and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these Rules shall apply to those ideas, which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain.</p>
<p>Please note that any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-cheating">Academic Integrity—Prohibition on Cheating</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.2)</p>
<p>Cheating is defined by its general usage. It includes, but is not limited to, the wrongfully giving, taking, or presenting any information or material by a student with the intent of aiding himself/herself or another on any academic work which is considered in any way in the determination of the final grade. The fact that a student could not have benefited from an action is not by itself proof that the action does not constitute cheating. Any question of definition shall be referred to the University Appeals Board.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-falsificationmisuse-of-academic-records">Academic Integrity–Prohibition on Falsification/Misuse of Academic Records</h4>
<p>(SR 6.3.3)</p>
<p>Maintaining the integrity, accuracy, and appropriate privacy of student academic records is an essential administrative function of the University and the basic protection of all students. Accordingly, the actual or attempted falsification, theft, misrepresentation, or other alteration or misuse of any official academic record of the University, specifically including knowingly having unauthorized access to such records or the unauthorized disclosure of information contained in such records, is a serious academic offense. As used in this context, &ldquo;academic record&rdquo; includes all paper and electronic versions of the partial or complete permanent academic record, all official and unofficial academic transcripts, application documents and admission credentials, and all academic record transaction documents. The minimum sanction for falsification, including the omission of information, or attempted falsification, or other misuses of academic records as described in this section is suspension for one semester.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-final-exams-information">“Multiple Final Exams” Information</h4>
<p>University Senate Rule 5.2.4.7. “Any student with more than two final examinations scheduled on any one date shall be entitled to have the examination for the class with the highest catalog number rescheduled at another time during the final examination period. In case this highest number is shared by more than one course, the one whose departmental prefix is first alphabetically will be rescheduled. The option to reschedule must be exercised in writing to the appropriate Instructor of Record or his/her designee two weeks before the last class meeting.”</p>
