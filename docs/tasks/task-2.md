# Task 2: Maps at the Gwen Curtis Map Collection

In this task, you will visit [UKy's Gwen Curtis Map Collection](https://libguides.uky.edu/maps) and find a map that you think is appealing. You will take a photo of the map, write a few paragraphs using our provided prompts, and post the photograph and response to Canvas.

Sarah Watson, the Map Collection Manager, will guide you through a curated selection of maps and help answer questions you might have.

When you peruse the collection, look for a map that speaks to you. It could be one that you think is beautiful, effective, or addresses a topic you like. It could be all of these. Then ask: What about the map do you find appealing? Investigate the map's design. Is it in the use of color, symbols, and fonts? Is it in the illustrations and information around the map and the story they tell? Think about the presentation as a whole: Is it persuasive? Does it make you want to visit the place? Does it make you want to take action?

## Scheduling a visit

You must book a time to visit the Map Collection. There are over 312 slots available in 24 different times between September 18 and October 8. You should be able to find a convenient time to visit the collection.
