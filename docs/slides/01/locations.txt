        My unique locations (not labeled or found on other maps).
        
        Water fountains for Limi Pepperoni walks downtown.
        He needs water on hot days!
        
        1. Thoroughbred Park
        2. Gratz Park
        3. Big Blue Building Plaza
        4. Courthouse Plaza
        
        I used Google Maps. While I can see the parks where the fountains 
        are located, they are not labeled. Google does a good job showing
        roads and businesses, but misses local, neighborhood attractions.
        Maybe because we cannot buy anything there. ðŸ¤·
