<h2>Task</h2>

In this task, you will visit [UKy's Gwen Curtis Map Collection](https://libguides.uky.edu/maps) and find a map that you think is appealing. You will take a photo of the map, write a few paragraphs using our provided prompts, and post the photograph and response to Canvas.

You must book a time to visit the Map Collection [here](https://libcal.uky.edu/calendar/geo109). There are over 200 slots available in 19 different times, so you should be able to find a convenient time to visit the collection. Sarah Watson, the Map Collection Manager, will guide you through a curated selection of maps and answer questions you might have about one that you find appealing.

When you peruse the collection, look for a map that speaks to you. It could be one that you think is beautiful, effective, or addresses a topic you like. It could be all of these. Then ask: What about the map do you find appealing? Investigate the map's design. Is it in the use of color, symbols, and fonts? Is it in the illustrations and information around the map and the story they tell? Think about the presentation as a whole: Is it persuasive? Does it make you want to visit the place? Does it make you want to take action?

This task is similar to our previous Maps in the Wild task, but this time, you will be looking at printed maps with a greater variety of purposes and intended audiences.

<div style="padding-left: 2em;padding-right: 2em;">

- Describe the map's purpose and intended audience. For example, is it a tourist map, a political map, or a map for a specific event? Is it a reference map or a thematic map? Is it for a general audience or a particular group of people?
- Describe what you find appealing about the map. Identify and discuss specific design elements in your response.
- Is the map effective or persuasive? What works and doesn't work well?
